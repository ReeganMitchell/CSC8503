# CSC8503

## Advanced Game Technologies

Much of the base code in this project was supplied by the university.

Most of the files located in CSC8503/GameTech were created by me. Examples include:

- Enemy.cpp
- ThrusterObject.cpp
- Position/RotationObstacle.cpp
- StateGameObject.cpp

and the relevant header files.

Other files that have methods edited or created by me are located in CSC8503/CSC8503Common.
Examples include:

-PhysicsSystem.cpp
-PhysicsObject.cpp
-CollisionDetection.cpp
